/* AI REVIEW COMMENTS
 * # Code Review of Vehicle.java
 * 
 * ## 1. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
 * 
 * ### Time Complexity Analysis
 * 1. **Constructor**: The constructor `Vehicle(String vehicleName, int capacity, int maxSpeed)` initializes three member variables. This operation runs in O(1) time, as it simply assigns values to the class fields.
 * 2. **Method `getVehicleInfo()`**: This method concatenates strings and returns a formatted vehicle information string. The time complexity is also O(1) in typical cases, since the length of the strings (vehicleName, etc.) can be considered constant relative to the action of concatenation when evaluating complexity for standard-sized vehicle names. It iterates through the fixed number of fields for formatting, which is constant.
 * 
 * ### Space Complexity Analysis
 * - The space complexity here is O(1) since the `Vehicle` instance occupies a fixed amount of space determined by the `String vehicleName`, `int capacity`, and `int maxSpeed`. No dynamic memory allocation occurs based on input size or number of vehicles. 
 * 
 * Memory usage includes:
 * - An object to hold the instance variables.
 * - The memory allocated for the string representation of the vehicle name, which can vary but is bound by the instance itself.
 * 
 * ## 2. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
 * 
 * ### Optimization Areas
 * The current implementation is simple and efficient for its intended purpose. However, there's a small opportunity to optimize the string concatenation method using `StringBuilder`, which can be more performant in cases of more extensive and complex string manipulations.
 * 
 * ### Suggested Code Snippet
 * ```java
 * public String getVehicleInfo() {
 *     return new StringBuilder()
 *         .append("Vehicle: ")
 *         .append(vehicleName)
 *         .append(", Capacity: ")
 *         .append(capacity)
 *         .append(" packages, Max Speed: ")
 *         .append(maxSpeed)
 *         .append(" km/h")
 *         .toString();
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * This improvement is more relevant in scenarios where this method might be called frequently, as `StringBuilder` avoids creating multiple immutable `String` objects during concatenation.
 * 
 * ## 3. ALGORITHMIC INSIGHTS
 * 
 * ### Patterns and Techniques
 * 1. **Data Encapsulation**: The code effectively encapsulates the vehicle's attributes, adhering to principles of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).
 * 2. **Immutability of Strings**: Using `String` type, although it is immutable, ensures safety but can lead to performance issues in situations involving frequent modifications or concatenations.
 * 
 * ### Alternative Approaches
 * 1. **Use of an Enum for Vehicle Types**: If vehicles can be categorized (e.g., Car, Truck, Bike), introducing an enum type could enhance the design. This would increase type safety and make comparisons easier.
 *    - Complexity remains O(1) but would establish more explicit relationships between vehicle types and their implementations.
 *    
 * 2. **Inheritance**: Create subclasses for different types of vehicles (Car, Truck, etc.), if additional properties or methods are to be added specific to those vehicle types.
 * 
 * ### Trade-offs
 * - Introducing enums or inheritance adds complexity but significantly enhances code organization and type safety against wrong instantiation scenarios.
 * - StringBuilder improves performance for larger strings but is unnecessary for simple cases; thus, use it where you expect to manipulate strings extensively.
 * 
 * ## 4. EDGE CASES & TESTING
 * 
 * ### Edge Cases
 * 1. Null values for `vehicleName`, `capacity`, or `maxSpeed`. The constructor may not handle such cases gracefully.
 * 2. Extreme values for `capacity` (e.g., negative values) and `maxSpeed` (e.g., negative speeds).
 * 3. Empty string for `vehicleName`.
 * 
 * ### Suggested Test Cases
 * ```java
 * public static void main(String[] args) {
 *     // Normal case
 *     Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle("Car", 4, 150);
 *     System.out.println(v1.getVehicleInfo()); // Expect a properly formatted string
 * 
 *     // Edge case: Null vehicle name
 *     Vehicle v2 = new Vehicle(null, 4, 150);
 *     System.out.println(v2.getVehicleInfo()); // Check how null is handled
 * 
 *     // Edge case: Extreme values
 *     Vehicle v3 = new Vehicle("Truck", -1, -100);
 *     System.out.println(v3.getVehicleInfo()); // Expecting unexpected behavior
 * 
 *     // Edge case: Empty name
 *     Vehicle v4 = new Vehicle("", 2, 80);
 *     System.out.println(v4.getVehicleInfo()); // Expecting to handle empty name
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * This thorough review evaluates the code for readability, efficiency, and potential edge cases. The suggested optimizations and alternative techniques would enhance robustness while retaining clarity.
