/* AI REVIEW COMMENTS
 * Certainly! Below is a detailed review of the `State.java` class, addressing the points you outlined.
 * 
 * ### 1. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
 * 
 * #### Time Complexity
 * The `State` class consists of a constructor and three fields. The operations performed in the constructor—assigning values to the fields—are constant time operations. Thus, the overall time complexity for construction is:
 * - **O(1)**: This is constant time because it does not vary with input size.
 * 
 * #### Space Complexity
 * The space complexity of the `State` class can be considered based on the instance variables:
 * - **String stateName**: consumes memory proportional to the length of the string, let's denote this as O(n), where n is the length of `stateName`.
 * - **int distanceFromDelhi**: consumes a fixed amount of memory (constant space) O(1).
 * - **int averageTime**: similarly consumes fixed memory O(1).
 * 
 * Putting this together, the overall space complexity for an instance of the `State` class is:
 * - **O(n)**, primarily dominated by the string storage.
 * 
 * ### 2. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
 * 
 * While the current implementation is straightforward and efficient for its purpose, there are opportunities for improvement:
 * 
 * #### Code Snippets for Optimized Solution
 * - **Immutability**: Making `State` instances immutable can lead to safer and potentially more optimized memory usage if the objects are frequently passed around.
 * - **Override `toString`, `equals`, and `hashCode` methods**: If instances of the `State` class are to be treated in collections or printed, implementing these methods would be beneficial.
 * 
 * Here is an improved version:
 * 
 * ```java
 * package Project;
 * 
 * public final class State {
 *     private final String stateName;
 *     private final int distanceFromDelhi;  // Consider making this final
 *     private final int averageTime;         // Consider making this final
 * 
 *     public State(String stateName, int distanceFromDelhi, int averageTime) {
 *         this.stateName = stateName;
 *         this.distanceFromDelhi = distanceFromDelhi;
 *         this.averageTime = averageTime;
 *     }
 * 
 *     public String getStateName() {
 *         return stateName;
 *     }
 * 
 *     public int getDistanceFromDelhi() {
 *         return distanceFromDelhi;
 *     }
 * 
 *     public int getAverageTime() {
 *         return averageTime;
 *     }
 * 
 *     @Override
 *     public String toString() {
 *         return "State{name='" + stateName + "', distanceFromDelhi=" + distanceFromDelhi + ", averageTime=" + averageTime + "}";
 *     }
 * 
 *     @Override
 *     public boolean equals(Object obj) {
 *         if (this == obj) return true;
 *         if (!(obj instanceof State)) return false;
 *         State state = (State) obj;
 *         return distanceFromDelhi == state.distanceFromDelhi && 
 *                averageTime == state.averageTime && 
 *                stateName.equals(state.stateName);
 *     }
 * 
 *     @Override
 *     public int hashCode() {
 *         return Objects.hash(stateName, distanceFromDelhi, averageTime);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### 3. ALGORITHMIC INSIGHTS
 * 
 * 1. **Immutability**: Using an immutable class pattern is a common technique that helps in producing thread-safe objects.
 * 2. **Encapsulation**: Providing getters while keeping the fields private is good practice for encapsulation.
 * 3. **Variable Naming**: The variable names are descriptive and align with Java conventions.
 * 
 * #### Alternative Approaches
 * For more complex scenarios, such as if the State needed more functionality (methods to calculate other properties, etc.), you might consider using design patterns such as Builder Pattern for easier management of state construction or Factory Method for creating State objects with specific configurations.
 * 
 * Trade-offs would involve added code complexity versus increased flexibility and readability. For instance, using a builder could lead to clearer creation of objects at the cost of additional setup.
 * 
 * ### 4. EDGE CASES & TESTING
 * 
 * #### Edge Cases
 * - **Null State Name**: If a `null` is passed as `stateName`, it will throw a `NullPointerException`. This should be handled either by throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` or by ensuring the name is never null.
 * - **Negative Values**: Consider validating that `distanceFromDelhi` and `averageTime` are non-negative; if not, they should throw an exception.
 * - **Long Strings**: Memory consumption might be a concern if strings are very long, which could cause performance delays or crashes in memory-constrained environments.
 * 
 * #### Suggested Test Cases
 * 1. Test creating a `State` instance with valid values.
 * 2. Test creating a `State` instance with `stateName` as `null`.
 * 3. Test creating a `State` with negative values for `distanceFromDelhi` and/or `averageTime`.
 * 4. Use the `equals` method to compare two `State` objects for equality.
 * 
 * By following these approaches, you can improve the robustness, maintainability, and efficiency of your `State` class.
