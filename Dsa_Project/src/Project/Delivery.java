/* AI REVIEW COMMENTS
 * # Review of Delivery.java
 * 
 * ## 1. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
 * 
 * ### Time Complexity
 * The current `Delivery` class does not contain any complex algorithms or iterations; it simply has a constructor and a few getter methods. Therefore, the time complexity can be broken down as follows:
 * 
 * - **Constructor (`Delivery(String location, Vehicle vehicle)`):**
 *   - Time Complexity: **O(1)** â€“ Assignments in the constructor are constant time operations.
 * 
 * - **Getter Methods (`getLocation()`, `getVehicle()`, and `getDeliveryDetails()`):**
 *   - `getLocation()`: O(1)
 *   - `getVehicle()`: O(1)
 *   - `getDeliveryDetails()`: The complexity of this method depends on the `getVehicleInfo()` method of the `Vehicle` class. Assuming `getVehicleInfo()` is also O(1), then `getDeliveryDetails()` is **O(1)**. If `getVehicleInfo()` is more complex, it needs separate analysis.
 * 
 * Thus, the overall time complexity for all operations is **O(1)**.
 * 
 * ### Space Complexity
 * The space complexity of the `Delivery` class is determined by the storage of its member variables:
 * 
 * - **Space for member variables:**
 *   - `String location`: O(n) space where n is the size of the string.
 *   - `Vehicle vehicle`: O(1) reference (but the vehicle object itself might occupy more space, depending on its internal implementation).
 * 
 * As such, the total space complexity can be denoted as **O(n)**, where n is the length of the `location` string.
 * 
 * ## 2. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
 * The current implementation is already quite efficient. However, one potential area to consider is in the `getDeliveryDetails()` method, where string concatenation is being performed.
 * 
 * ### Suggested Optimization:
 * Using `StringBuilder` for string concatenation can improve performance, especially if many concatenations are made in different scenarios. Here's how we might refactor `getDeliveryDetails()`.
 * 
 * ### Optimized Code Snippet:
 * ```java
 * public String getDeliveryDetails() {
 *     StringBuilder details = new StringBuilder();
 *     details.append("Delivery Location: ")
 *            .append(location)
 *            .append(", Vehicle: ")
 *            .append(vehicle.getVehicleInfo());
 *     return details.toString();
 * }
 * ```
 * This modification would improve performance in scenarios of high string concatenation due to reduced string immutability overhead.
 * 
 * ## 3. ALGORITHMIC INSIGHTS
 * ### Patterns and Techniques Used
 * - **Encapsulation**: The class practices encapsulation by using private member variables and public getter methods to access them.
 * - **Object Composition**: The `Delivery` class is making use of composition by including a `Vehicle` object.
 * 
 * ### Alternative Approaches:
 * If you need more functionality, you might consider implementing interfaces for different types of deliveries or vehicles. 
 * 
 * 1. **Using Interfaces**: 
 *    - Define a `DeliveryInterface` and a `VehicleInterface` which could allow for polymorphism.
 *    - Complexity of the operations would remain O(1), but with added extensibility.
 * 
 * ### Trade-offs:
 * - The current structure is simple and lightweight, which is beneficial for readability and maintenance. Adding interfaces will increase complexity in terms of the structure but add flexibility in case of multiple vehicle types and delivery methods.
 * 
 * ## 4. EDGE CASES & TESTING
 * 
 * ### Edge Cases:
 * 1. **Null Location or Vehicle**: If the location or vehicle is `null`, it may lead to a `NullPointerException` on calling methods like `getVehicleInfo()`.
 * 2. **Empty Location**: A scenario where the location is an empty string could be semantically incorrect.
 * 
 * ### Suggested Test Cases:
 * 1. **Null Values**:
 *    - Test using `new Delivery(null, null)`, ensure that methods handle null gracefully.
 *    
 * 2. **Empty Location**:
 *    ```java
 *    Delivery delivery = new Delivery("", new Vehicle()); // Assuming Vehicle has a default constructor.
 *    assertEquals("Delivery Location: , Vehicle: Vehicle Info", delivery.getDeliveryDetails());
 *    ```
 * 
 * 3. **Standard Values**:
 *    - Create a standard delivery with expected inputs and check if `getDeliveryDetails()` provides the correct output.
 * 
 * By ensuring these edge cases and conducting thorough tests, the robustness of the class can be increased. 
 * 
 * Overall, the `Delivery` class is succinct but should ensure defensive programming principles are applied to enhance reliability in more extensive applications.
