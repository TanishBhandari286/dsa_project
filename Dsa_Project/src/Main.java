/* AI REVIEW COMMENTS
 * Based on the provided Java code in `Main.java`, let's conduct a detailed review addressing complexity analysis, optimization opportunities, algorithmic insights, and edge cases & testing.
 * 
 * ### 1. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
 * 
 * #### Time Complexity
 * - The code features a loop that runs from 1 to 5. The loop runs exactly 5 times, which results in a constant time complexity of **O(1)**. 
 *   - Each iteration performs a single print operation that takes **O(1)** time, so the total time complexity for the loop section can also be represented as **O(5)**, which simplifies to **O(1)** for large `n`.
 * 
 * #### Space Complexity
 * - The space complexity in this scenario is also **O(1)**. 
 *   - We are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size; the variables used (like `i`) consume a constant amount of space regardless of any input.
 * 
 * ### 2. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
 * 
 * #### Areas for Improvement
 * - Since the loop operates over a fixed range and performs a constant number of computations, there are not significant opportunities for performance optimization in a traditional sense. However, we can make the output more formal or adjustable.
 * 
 * #### Example for Dynamic Range
 * If the intention is to make the loop dynamic so that it can handle different output ranges, we could modify the code to accept user input. Here is an example:
 * 
 * ```java
 * import java.util.Scanner;
 * 
 * public class Main {
 *     public static void main(String[] args) {
 *         System.out.printf("Hello and welcome!");
 * 
 *         Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 *         System.out.print("Enter the number of times to print: ");
 *         int n = scanner.nextInt(); // Read user input for iterations
 * 
 *         for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
 *             System.out.println("i = " + i);
 *         }
 *         
 *         scanner.close(); // Always close the scanner to avoid resource leaks
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * - **Time Complexity**: In this case, if the input `n` is the number that the loop iterates to, the time complexity would be **O(n)**.
 * - **Space Complexity**: Remains **O(1)** as we only use a fixed amount of space despite the dynamic nature of `n`.
 * 
 * ### 3. ALGORITHMIC INSIGHTS
 * 
 * #### Patterns & Techniques
 * - The current implementation follows a straightforward iterative pattern, ideal for simple counting and printing tasks. The loop is a common programming technique taught as a basic example of iteration.
 * 
 * #### Alternative Approaches
 * - Instead of a standard loop, one could explore recursive techniques for educational purposes, which might offer a different perspective on problems that can also be solvable through iterative means. 
 * 
 * Example of a recursive approach:
 * 
 * ```java
 * public class Main {
 *     public static void main(String[] args) {
 *         System.out.printf("Hello and welcome!");
 *         
 *         printNumbers(1, 5); // You can modify this call if you want dynamic ranges
 *     }
 * 
 *     static void printNumbers(int current, int max) {
 *         if (current > max) return;
 *         System.out.println("i = " + current);
 *         printNumbers(current + 1, max);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * - **Complexity**:
 *   - Time: **O(n)** for `n` numbers.
 *   - Space: **O(n)** for the call stack if `n` is large, leading to potential stack overflow for very high `n`.
 * 
 * ### 4. EDGE CASES & TESTING
 * 
 * #### Edge Cases
 * - **Zero or Negative Input**: If user input is less than 1, the loop would run zero times or not at all. This leads to no output being generated.
 * - **Non-Numeric Input**: Handling input that is not a number, which would cause an exception.
 * 
 * #### Suggested Test Cases
 * - Input `0`: Should produce no output (edge case).
 * - Input `5`: Regular case, should print numbers 1 to 5.
 * - Input `-1`: Should produce no output (edge case).
 * - Input `10`: Should print numbers from 1 to 10.
 * - Input a non-numeric string (e.g., "abc"): The program should handle the exception gracefully and inform the user of invalid input.
 * 
 * ### Conclusion
 * Overall, while the original code is simple and meets its objective without performance issues, there are opportunities to make it more dynamic. Further, potential edge case considerations should be implemented to enhance robustness.
