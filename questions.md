# Follow-Up Questions for Dsa_Project Repository

## Understanding of Algorithms and Data Structures

### 1. Class Relationships
1. **What design principles are evident in how the `Delivery`, `Vehicle`, and `State` classes interact?**
   - Discuss the concepts of composition and encapsulation.

2. **Can you explain the choice of using an array for states (`State[] states`)? Would using a different data structure, such as a List, have been more beneficial? Why or why not?**

### 2. Algorithm Implementation
3. **In the `RouteOptimizer` class, how are you managing the addition of delivery locations and vehicles? What data structures are utilized, and why is a List chosen over an array for these operations?**

4. **What is the role of the `calculateRoutes()` method within the context of `addDeliveryLocations` and `addVehicles`? Can you elaborate on your thought process for handling routes?**

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### 3. Complexity of Implementations
5. **Discuss the time complexity for adding delivery locations. How does the size of the list affect this operation? What happens if you have a very large number of deliveries?**

6. **Evaluate the space complexity of the `Delivery` class. How does the space required vary with the size of the `location` string?**

### 4. Complexity Trade-offs
7. **In the `Vehicle` class, what are the implications of using string concatenation in the `getVehicleInfo()` method in terms of performance? How does using `StringBuilder` optimize this?**

## Optimizations and Alternative Approaches

### 5. Potential Enhancements
8. **If you wanted to allow the `State` class to support dynamic updates or changes, such as modifying the distance from Delhi, what changes would you consider? Would you favor immutability for `State` instances?**

9. **Could the `RouteOptimizer` class benefit from a more sophisticated route calculation algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's or A* algorithm)? Discuss how the current approach might limit the optimization of delivery routes.**

### 6. Alternative Data Structures
10. **How would you modify the `vehicles` list to improve the efficiency of vehicle queries? Could a Map or Set be advantageous in certain scenarios? Justify your answer.**

## Edge Cases and Testing Scenarios

### 7. Handling Edge Cases
11. **Identify and discuss potential edge cases in the `Delivery` constructor. How would you ensure robust input handling, particularly for `location` and `vehicle`?**

12. **When adding vehicles in `addVehicles()`, how would you handle non-integer inputs for capacity and maximum speed? What error handling mechanisms would you implement?**

### 8. Testing Strategies
13. **What test scenarios would you implement to validate edge cases in the `getDeliveryDetails()` method of the `Delivery` class? How would you ensure that the edge cases are sufficiently covered?**

14. **Discuss how you would go about testing the implementation of `RouteOptimizer`. What kind of unit tests would you write for the `addDeliveryLocations()` method?**

## Theoretical Foundations

### 9. Data Structure Knowledge
15. **What are the theoretical underpinnings surrounding the selection of data structures in this project (e.g., array vs. list)? Can you explain the implications of choosing one over the other?**

16. **Can you provide an overview of how the average time complexity for delivering with a vehicle could change if the data set (states, deliveries, vehicles) were significantly larger? What considerations around algorithm scalability come into play?**

### 10. General Algorithmic Principles
17. **Discuss the factors influencing the design of the `RouteOptimizer` loop menu. What algorithmic principles did you apply to ensure user choices are handled effectively?**

18. **Can you explain the importance of time and space complexity in the context of this project? How do these factors influence design choices?**

## Conclusion

### 11. Future Enhancements
19. **What features would you consider adding to the `RouteOptimizer` or `Delivery` classes to improve functionality? Discuss both algorithmic and data structure considerations.**

20. **If you had to refactor the current implementation to support multi-threaded execution for handling deliveries concurrently, what changes would you implement in your current classes? Explain your rationale.**

These questions are designed to assess a developer's comprehensive understanding of the repository's algorithms, structure, and design decisions, alongside their knowledge of complexity and testing principles that are critical in software engineering.
// --- Auto Review (DSA) ---
// DSA Review (Linked List)
// Complexity hints: iterative loop(s) present (baseline O(n))
// Easy: Detect and remove cycle (Floyd) and find cycle start.
// Medium: Merge two sorted lists; iterative vs. recursive tradeoffs.
// Hard: LRU cache with list+hash; operations and complexity.
